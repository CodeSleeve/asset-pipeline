## What is Asset Pipeline?

For those of you familiar with Rails asset pipeline and sprockets, you will hopefully feel right at home using this package.

For those of you unfamiliar with Rails asset pipeline and sprockets, I suggest reading [introduction to directives](#introduction-to-directives).

## Installation

Begin by installing this package through Composer. Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require `codesleeve/asset-pipeline`.

It might look something like:

```php
  "require": {
    "laravel/framework": "4.1.*",
    "codesleeve/asset-pipeline": "dev-master"
  }
```

Next, update Composer from the Terminal:

```php
    composer update
```

Once this operation completes, add the service provider. Open `app/config/app.php`, add the following items to the providers array.

```php
    'Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\AssetPipelineServiceProvider',
```

Next optionally, ensure your environment is setup correctly because by default the asset pipeline will cache and and minify assets on a production environment.

Inside `bootstrap/start.php`

```php
  $env = $app->detectEnvironment(array(
    'local' => array('your-machine-name'),
  ));
```

Run the `artisan` command from the Terminal for the `assets:setup` command. This will create the default folder structure for you.

```php
    php artisan assets:setup
```

## Usage

Place these lines into your Laravel view/layout

```php
    <?= stylesheet_link_tag() ?>
    <?= javascript_include_tag() ?>
```

This will generate a listing of script and link tags for all the dependencies listed in `app/assets/application.js` and `app/assets/application.css`.

#### Parameters

If you'd like to control which manifest file you'd like to use and even put attributes on the tags. This follows the same pattern rails uses, so for example, if we have this:

```php
    <?= javascript_include_tag('interior/application', ['data-foo' => 'bar']) ?>
```

and assuming `concat => array('production')` and we are on a production environment then this generates

```php
    <script src="assets/interior/application.js" data-foo="bar"></script>
```

## Introduction to Directives

Let's open up the default javascript manifest file `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`. You should see something like

```javascript

//
//= require jquery
//= require_tree .

```

This will bring in the file  `/provider/assets/javascripts/jquery.min.js` and also all files and sub directories within in `/app/assets/javascripts` folder.

This is how you control your dependencies. Simple right?

#### Here is a list of directives you can use

  - **require** filename

    This brings in a specific asset file found within your `paths`.

  - **require_directory** some/directory

    This brings in assets only within some/directory (non-recursive). You can also use '.' and '..' to resolve paths relative to the manifest file itself.

  - **require_tree** some/directory

    Just like require_directory except it recursively brings in all sub directories and files.

  - **require_tree_df** some/directory

    This works just like require_tree but it includes directories first and files last where as
    require_tree brings in files first then directories. You might use this if you have dependencies
    inside of sub-directories that you want to include first before a file in that same directory.

  - **require_self**

    This brings in the manifest file itself as an asset. This is already done on `require_tree .` if the manifest file is within that directory. Where you might want to use this is when you have a manifest file that does like `require_tree subdir/`

  - **include** filename

    This brings in a specific asset file found within your `paths`. It differs from **require** though
    because if the file is not found then it does not throw an exception.

  - **stub** path

    Blacklists the given path. This can be a file or an entire directory. Note that once a path is blacklisted it will be ignored no matter how many times you try to included it.

  - **depend_on** filename

    Let asset pipeline know about a dependency not required through the manifest file. If file1 **depend_on** file2 then the local cache for file1 will be busted when file2 changes. This is very useful for when you are using `@import` in less.

## Configuration

To create a custom package config for [configuration of the asset pipeline.](#configuration) run

```php
  php artisan config:publish codesleeve/asset-pipeline
```

### routing array

```php
  'routing' => array(
    'prefix' => '/assets'
  ),
```

Sprockets parser also uses this to help generate the correct web path for our assets. It is also used by the asset pipeline for routing.


### paths

```php
  'paths' => array(
    'app/assets/javascripts',
    'app/assets/stylesheets',
    'app/assets/images',
    'lib/assets/javascripts',
    'lib/assets/stylesheets',
    'lib/assets/images',
    'provider/assets/javascripts',
    'provider/assets/stylesheets',
    'provider/assets/images'
  ),
```

These are the directories we search for files in. You can think of this like PATH environment variable on your OS. We search for files in the path order listed below.

### mimes

```php
  'mimes' => array(
      'javascripts' => array('.js', '.js.coffee', '.coffee', '.html', '.min.js'),
      'stylesheets' => array('.css', '.css.less', '.css.scss', '.less', '.scss', '.min.css'),
  ),
```

In order to know which mime type to send back to the server we need to know if it is a javascript or stylesheet type. If the extension is not found below then we just return a regular download. You should include all extensions in your `filters` here or you will likely experience unexpected behavior. This should allow developers to mix javascript and css files in the same directory.

### filters

```php
  'filters' => array(
    '.min.js' => array(

    ),
    '.min.css' => array(
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\URLRewrite,
    ),
    '.js' => array(
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\JSMinPlusFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.js.coffee' => array(
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CoffeeScript,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\JSMinPlusFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.coffee' => array(
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CoffeeScript,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\JSMinPlusFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.css' => array(
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\URLRewrite,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CssMinFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.css.less' => array(
      new Assetic\Filter\LessphpFilter,
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\URLRewrite,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CssMinFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.css.scss' => array(
      new Assetic\Filter\ScssphpFilter,
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\URLRewrite,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CssMinFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.less' => array(
      new Assetic\Filter\LessphpFilter,
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\URLRewrite,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CssMinFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.scss' => array(
      new Assetic\Filter\ScssphpFilter,
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\URLRewrite,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\CssMinFilter, App::environment()),
    ),
    '.html' => array(
      new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\JST,
      new EnvironmentFilter(new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\JSMinPlusFilter, App::environment()),
    )
  ),
```

In order for a file to be included with sprockets, the extension needs to be listed here. We can also preprocess those extension types with Assetic Filters.

### cache

```php
  'cache' => array(),   // add 'production' here if you want to cache permanently
```

**By default we cache all files regardless of the environment.**

However, we only cache manifest files when in production mode or whatever environments are supplied to `cache`.


### cache_server

```php
  'cache_server' => new Assetic\Cache\FilesystemCache(App::make('path.storage') . '/cache/asset-pipeline'),
```

By default we use Assetic's FilesystemCache to handle caching but you can create your own [CacheInterface](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic/blob/master/src/Assetic/Cache) if you want to handle caching differently.

Caching is used here to speed up when developing locally and production as well. To get an idea of how this works, let's say you are dealing with 80 coffeescript files. You wouldn't want to run pre-compilation on all 80 files each time you load a page. Pipeline will cache all 80 coffeescript files so we only run pre-compilation if one of those files is changed. This makes your pages load faster in when developing.

The only downside to this is if you change your Laravel environment or config for asset pipeline then you will need to clear your cache to see the changes reflected.

If you want to clear your cache then run

```php
   php artisan assets:clean
```

This will clear the cached files `application.js` and `application.css` and all required files from within the manifest files. If you have other files you want cleaned then you can pass them as parameters via `-f` or `--file`

```php
  php artisan assets:clean -f interior/application.js -f exterior/application.js -f interior/application.css -f exterior/application.css
```

If you don't want to recursively remove cache files for a manifest file then you can pass the `--recursive=false` flag.

**NOTE** If you are using the default configuration for pipeline you can remove your cached files in this directory

```
  $ rm -f app/storage/cache/asset-pipeline/*
```

### cache_client

```php
  'cache_client' => new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Filters\ClientCacheFilter,
```

If you want to handle 304's and what not, to keep users from refetching your assets and saving your bandwidth you can use a cache_client driver that handles this. This doesn't handle assets on the server-side, use cache_server for that.

Note that this needs to implement the interface

    Codesleeve\Sprockets\Interfaces\ClientCacheInterface

or this won't work correctly. It is a wrapper class around your cache_server driver and also uses the AssetCache class to help access files `lastModifiedTime` because `Assetic\Cache\CacheInterface` doesn't give us this ability.

### concat

```php
  'concat' => array('production', 'local')
```

This allows us to turn on the asset concatenation for the specific environments listed. For performance reasons, we recommend keeping this turned on except if you are trying to troubleshoot an javascript issue.


### directives

```php
  'directives' => array(
    'require ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\RequireFile,
    'require_directory ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\RequireDirectory,
    'require_tree ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\RequireTree,
    'require_tree_df ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\RequireTreeDf,
    'require_self' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\RequireSelf,
    'include ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\IncludeFile,
    'stub ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\Stub,
    'depend_on ' => new Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\DependOn,
  ),
```

These are the directives we try to process inside of manifest files. This allows you to swap out, add new, modify existing directives for your pipeline setup.


### javascript_include_tag

```php
  'javascript_include_tag' => new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Composers\JavascriptComposer,
```

When you do `<?= javascript_include_tag() ?>` this composer class will be invoked. This allows you to compose your own javascript tags if you want to modify how javascript tags are printed.


### stylesheet_link_tag

```php
  'stylesheet_link_tag' => new Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\Composers\StylesheetComposer,
```

When you do `<?= stylesheet_link_tag() ?>` this composer class will be invoked. This allows you to compose your own stylesheet tags if you want to modify how stylesheet tags are printed.


### controller_action

```php
  'controller_action' => '\Codesleeve\AssetPipeline\AssetPipelineController@file',
```

This is the controller action the pipeline routes all incoming requests to. If you ever want to swap this out for your own implementation you can edit this. This allows you to completely control how assets are being served to the browser.


### sprockets_filter

```php
  'sprockets_filter' => '\Codesleeve\Sprockets\SprocketsFilter',
```

When concatenation is turned on, all assets fetched from the sprockets generator are filtered through this filter class. This allows us to modify the sprockets filter if we need to behave differently.


## FAQ

### Can I modify the asset pipeline config at runtime?

You can listen to `asset.pipeline.boot` event and this will pass the pipeline object to you for any changes you might want to make.

```php
  Event::listen('asset.pipeline.boot', function($pipeline) {
    $config = $pipeline->getConfig();

    $config['paths'][] = 'some/special/javascripts';
    $config['paths'][] = 'some/special/stylesheets';

    $config['mimes']['javascripts'][] = '.foo.bar';

    $config['filters']['.foo.bar'] = array(
      new My\Special\Filter
    );

    $pipeline->setConfig($config);
  });
```

This code registers two new paths and creates a new extension called .foo.bar that is filtered with `My\Special\Filter`. Using the event listener allows us to extend the functionality of the asset pipeline in separate packages.

### Can I do Javascript Templates (JST)

Yes. Out of the box you can use .html files somewhere within your `app/assets/javascripts` folder and you will be given a JST array on your front end javascript that contains the html page. If you want a different extension (i.e. jst.hbs) you will need to bring that in.

### Can I do images, fonts, and other files?

Files that are not in the `mime` and `filters` array of our configuration will be treated as regular files. You can still access them via web urls, but they will trigger a `Response::download` instead of being served as javascript or stylesheet files.

### Can I do conditional includes?

There is no built-in mechanism to conditionally include assets via the asset pipeline. One technique  I use is to namespace my html page in my layout view. I create a View::share that always contains the current route for me.

```html
  <html class="<?= $currentRoute ?>" lang="en">
```

This allows me to prefix my css with the route. So if I only wanted a blue background on the home page I could do something like this.

```css
  html.home.index body {
    background-color: blue;
  }
```

If you are trying to conditionally include javascript on a page, I recommend the use of bindings. Create specific scripts that will only be run when certain data attributes or class names are found.

```js
  $('[data-foo]').each(function()
  {
    console.log('only run when we find data-foo="" attribute');
  });
```

And so if we have an element like this it will run

```html
  <a data-foo="bar" href="#">Hey there</a>
```

If you find yourself having issues with conditionally including assets your best bet may be to break apart your manifest files into sections that make sense for your application. For example, if your application is silo'ed into admin section and user section then it probably makes sense to have a separate manifest file for each section.

### Can I hook in my own packages for asset pipeline?

Yes. By using the event listener `asset.pipeline.boot` you can intercept the pipeline object and modify the configuration array to your own will. But remember with great power comes great responsibility. Here is an example,

```php

Event::listen('asset.pipeline.boot', function($pipeline)
{
    $config = $pipeline->getConfig();
    $config['directives']['awesome_directive'] = new MyAwesomeDirective;
    $pipeline->setConfig($config);
});

```
So what does MyAwesomeDirective look like? That is entirely up to you.

```php
class MyAwesomeDirective extends Codesleeve\Sprockets\Directives\RequireFile
{
  public function process($param)
  {
      $files = array();

      if (App::environment() === 'local' && $param == 'foobar')
      {
        // do chicken dance and add some files to array
        // also, this needs to be an absolute path to file
        $files[] = __DIR__ . '/chicken/dance.js';
      }

      return $files;
  }
}
```

### Can I use nginx

You may have to configure nginx. The files are not in `/assets/` so you will likely get a 404. Thus you need to tell nginx to route the request through `index.php` if the file is not found. This can be accomplished with something like this:

```js
  location ~ ^/(assets)/{
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    expires max;
    add_header Cache-Control public;
  }
```

### Can I use an older version of asset pipeline

The asset pipeline has been re-factored to be smarter, cleaner, better. However, with that brought along breaking changes because things work differently. So if you have older existing projects that were pointing to `dev-master`, you should probably find a tag version that works for you. If it just recently broke, try the latest tag minus 1. Also, I typically push out my changes to `dev-testing`.


### Can I do image optimization?

The asset pipeline doesn't do this for you. However, there is nothing stopping you from handling image optimization via a separate script and then including those optimized images through asset pipeline.

For more information [check out this issue](https://github.com/CodeSleeve/asset-pipeline/issues/128).


### How does caching work?

For performance reasons, all files are cached using the `cache_server` driver in asset pipeline's configuration file. This is done so you don't have to pre-compile 100's of coffeescript and less/sass files each time you reload the page and fetch assets. However, this can cause confusion sometimes, for example, if you update a [filter](#filters) in the asset pipeline config and then refresh the page and things are still be cached. In this case you should [manually clear the cache](#cache_server).

When your environment matches an environment found in the configured [cache](#cache) array then assets will be permanently cached until manually cleared using `assets:clean`. By default this used to be `production`, however due to the frustration and confusion many developers were having this was removed. So if you want to use caching on your server you need to opt-in and edit your configuration file.
